@for        Operating Systems - Mini Libc

______________________
Implementation Details
    |  String  ->  String operations do not use syscalls, therefore I just
    |  used operations on pointers. (unless it's strdup)

    | Memory -> I used lists for keeping track of the allocated heap memory
    |           and used mmap syscalls to allocate memory for each call

    | Stat -> For stat and fstat I initially used statx and wrapped kernel
    |         struct statx into struct stat, keeping only the information
    |         requiered. Then, after issues with checker, I used syscall.
